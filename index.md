The GitHub Pages feature allows you to publish content to the web by simply pushing content to one of your GitHub hosted repositories. There are two different kinds of Pages that you can create: **User Pages** and **Project Pages**.

User & Organization Pages
=========================

Let's say your GitHub username is "alice". If you create a GitHub repository named `alice.github.com`, commit a file named `index.html` into the `master` branch, and push it to GitHub, then this file will be automatically published to [http://alice.github.com/](http://alice.github.com/).

On the first push, it can take up to ten minutes before the content is available.

The same works for organizations.  If your org account is named "PlanEx", creating the repo `planex.github.com` under the org will publish pages to <http://planex.github.com/>.

Real World Example: [github.com/defunkt/defunkt.github.com](http://github.com/defunkt/defunkt.github.com/) &rarr; [http://defunkt.github.com/](http://defunkt.github.com/).

## Atea
### Arte Taller Estudio Arquitectura

ATEA is a multidisciplinary and collaborative platform of production and experimentation, a place that promotes practices that push for the reinvention of common imaginaries within urban space. An open space for collective creation and knowledge interchange.

Located within one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Mexico City (stereotyped by commerce, prostitution and violence within mainstream media), ATEA looks to detonate production processes and to question the roles of modern consumption through promoting, developing and implementing exhibitions, residencies, workshops, artistic and architectural research practices 

Founded in December 2010, ATEA seeks to promote and generate a cross platform dialogue that responds to current social conditions, across different disciplines (architecture, contemporary art, film, music and urban research); while extending the architectonic-artistic practice to community participation and collective creation.
