ATEA is a multidisciplinary and collaborative platform of production and experimentation, a place that promotes practices that push for the reinvention of common imaginaries within urban space. An open space for collective creation and knowledge interchange.

Located within one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Mexico City (stereotyped by commerce, prostitution and violence within mainstream media), ATEA looks to detonate production processes and to question the roles of modern consumption through promoting, developing and implementing exhibitions, residencies, workshops, artistic and architectural research practices 

Founded in December 2010, ATEA seeks to promote and generate a cross platform dialogue that responds to current social conditions, across different disciplines (architecture, contemporary art, film, music and urban research); while extending the architectonic-artistic practice to community participation and collective creation.
